# Starbucks-Capstone

As a quest for learning data analytics and data science, I enrolled in the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree. The capstone project requirement is a challenge to analyze three datasets provided by Starbucks.

# Installations
This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
json
seaborn
matplotlib
sklearn

### Data Dictionary

The challenge analyses three separate datasets:
profile.json
It contains the data points like demographics, date of joining, etc., on the various users and members of the rewards program.
portfolio.json
It contains information about the offers sent during 30-day test period. It describes the characteristics of each offer, like the type, its duration, etc.
transcript.json
It contains the event log, that is, whether the offer was received, viewed, or completed. It also contains the customer IDs as well as the offer IDs. It's the most extensive and biggest dataset of all three.

### Objective

The objective of this project is to:
I. Perform exploratory analysis of the three datasets.
II. Calculate the success rate of a particular offer.
III. Build a model that can predict the success of the offer.
